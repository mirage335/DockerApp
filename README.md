Docker base/image/container management infrastructure, intended for standalone applications.

# Usage

./launch _setup ./dockerfiles/unimportant-hello-scratch

./launch ./dockerfiles/unimportant-hello-scratch

# Design

Complex structure of shell script may seem excessive, but emphasizes scalability to more powerful solutions.

# Features

* Override internal functionality with 'ops' script.
* Resources (ie. images/containers) automatically given unique names derived from application directory.
* Symlink compatibility. Both launch and anchor scripts may be called as a symlink at ~/bin/appName .

# Ratings

* Application directory naming must follow the naming convention container[-image][-base] .
* Unique names are required for all application container/image combinations, even if different bases are used.
* Characters not allowed by filename (ie. :/) may be used through an accompanying "ops" script. Consider unimportant-hello:mirage335_debian_jessie-mirage335/debian:jessie .
* Specifying identical base/image names should result in the container being directly based, without an intermediate image. Doing so may complicate committng and backing up container changes.

# SAFETY

* Despite the _safeRMR wrapper, incidents are still theoretically possible, and commands like "rm -rf" are ultimately used. Be careful.
* Resources called by this script (ie. mkimage) are untrusted. Carefully verify these scripts before using on production systems.

# FutureWork

* Backup of working container to image stored in application directory. Completion of load/save/modify image functions.
