#Retrieves absolute path of current script, while maintaining symlinks, even when "./" would translate with "readlink -f" into something disregarding symlinked components in $PWD.

#Suitable for allowing scripts to find other scripts they depend on. May look like an ugly hack, but it has proven reliable over the years.
